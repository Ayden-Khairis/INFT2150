### Assignment 
In this group report, we were required to analyse Lime Micromobility - Electric Scooter and Bike Rentals. 
We used a wide variety of analysis techniques to conduct resaerch into Lime Micromobility such as Systems Modelling, Stakeholder Analysis, SWOT Analysis, and Problem Identification & Description.

### My Contribution
